My first journal paper has now been published!
Here is a link to the paper: [Analysis of roll damping model scale data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445302.2021.1907070)

The research was conducted in the following GitHub repo: [rolldecay](https://github.com/martinlarsalbert/rolldecay).
Many of the developed methods have been put in the following python package: [rolldecay-estimators](https://github.com/martinlarsalbert/rolldecay-estimators).
