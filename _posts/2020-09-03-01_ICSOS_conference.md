## Notes about papers/presenations
Here are my notes from the [ICSOS 2020 conference](https://www.icsos.info/).
A lot of the presentation that I found interesting were from [NTNU Ã…lesund](https://www.ntnu.edu/ihb).

### A dockin simulation framework: model evaluation and expert knowledge data harvesting
A paper by [Marco Mirkulec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-mikulec-8879559a/) et.al. They have used [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to make a simple simulation for docking simulations, very cool.

### Parameter identification of nonlinear ship maneuvering model using support vector machine method
A paper by Tongtong Wang et.al. about system identification of manoeuvring tests using Support Vector Machine regression (SVR).
* SVM is better than Least Square Fit in handling initial values and noise.
* 3DOF Abkowitz model i used
* Linear kernel in SVM
* The system identification works extremly good (I'm impressed).

### Fast Virtual Prototyping a case study with the RV Gunnerus reaseach vessel
A paper by [Pierre Major](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-major-b72598/) et.al.
* Digital twin = predictin an existing ship (usually a lot of measurement data avaliable)
* Virtual prototype = Nonexistong ship (usually less data avaliable)
* There were some interesting simulators:
  * [opensimulationplatform](https://opensimulationplatform.com/)
  * [fhsim](https://fhsim.no/docs/licence.html)
  * [fmi-standard](https://fmi-standard.org/)
