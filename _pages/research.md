## 2020
I have had the privilige to work as Industrial PHD in a project called [DEMOPS](https://www.chalmers.se/en/projects/Pages/Machine-learning-based-speed-power-performance-modelling-to.aspx) which roughly stands for Development of Machine Learning for Operational Performance of Ships.

## 2021
The industrial PHD project is now working in the project: [Data-driven energy efficiency of ships](https://oceanenergy-sweden.se/energieffektivisering-av-mindre-fartyg/)(D2E2F).
