Here are my notes from this conference. . toc: true | branch: master | badges: true | comments: true | categories: [dynamics, kalman filter] | image: https://le-cdn.website-editor.net/a88a366fb4174f939aa349fe67bc7d1e/dms3rep/multi/opt/ICSOS-640w.png | hide: false | search_exclude: true | metadata_key1: metadata_value1 | metadata_key2: metadata_value2 | . Notes about papers/presenations . A dockin simulation framework: model evaluation and expert knowledge data harvesting . A paper by Marco Mirkulec et.al. They have used (pygame)[https://www.pygame.org/] to make a simple simulation for docking simulations, very cool. . Parameter identification of nonlinear ship maneuvering model using support vector machine method . A paper by Tongtong Wang et.al. about system identification of manoeuvring tests using Support Vector Machine regression (SVR). . SVM is better than Least Square Fit in handling initial values and noise. | 3DOF Abkowitz model i used | Linear kernel in SVM | The system identification works extremly good (I’m impressed). | . Fast Virtual Prototyping a case study with the RV Gunnerus reaseach vessel . A paper by Pierre Major et.al. . Digital twin = predictin an existing ship (usually a lot of measurement data avaliable) | Virtual prototype = Nonexistong ship (usually less data avaliable) | (opensimulationplatform)[https://opensimulationplatform.com/] | (fhsim)[https://fhsim.no/docs/licence.html] | (fmi-standard)[https://fmi-standard.org/] | .",
